<p><strong>Components of the web</strong></p>
<p>Browser - Reads and displays HTML</p>
<p>The Net - Provides connectivity</p>
<p>Servers - Computers that store and send copies of HTML documents</p>
<p>Transfer Protocol - The transmission method for requesting, retrieving, sending, and receiving the HTML files</p>
<br>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>
<p><b>Structure</b></p>
<p>HTML is the backbone of the web, which is really just billions of HTML documents. The tags open and close with the Greater than and Less than characters.  They have names, and attributes. The closing tag is the same as the opening, except it uses the slash switch inside the tag, right in front of the name.Void tags don't need a closing tag. Some tags have multiple attributes at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Inline Tags</b></p>
<p>Anchor - Adds links</p>
<p>Break - like a return character</p>
<p>Image - A graphic</p>
<p>Span - Don't know exactly what the point of this is</p>
<br>
<p><b>Block Tags</b></p>
<p>Paragraph - Creates an invisible box</p>
<p>Div - Also creates an invisible box</p>
<br>
<p><b>Whitespace</b></p> 
<p>It doesn't matter how much whitespace you add when edting HTML, you cannot use the Return key or space bar to add whitespace to the HTML document just by typing it into the HTML. It always reads as just one space.</p>
